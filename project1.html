      <h2 class="content-title">About</h2>
      <p class="content-text">
        To drive sales of portable projectors, we conducted user research and testing, ultimately launching a projector that targets these users' needs, featuring a flexible base design that offers users the freedom to project from any desired angle while relaxing comfortably in bed. The first-year sales grew by 148%, and the accompanying app solution was downloaded at a rate 1.1 times the number of projectors sold.

        <h3 class="subsection-title">User Interviews</h3>
        <p class="content-text">
          We interviewed 8 users in our target markets to explore the daily use scenarios and pain points of projector use. We found that while portability is a strong appeal, comfort during viewing — especially from bed — is often compromised.

        <p class="content-text">
          We compared popular portable projectors on factors like adjustability, visual comfort, and software experience. The lack of flexibility in angle adjustment was a recurring flaw. <br /><br />

        <p class="content-text">
          We explored several form factors to address viewing comfort in bed. Early sketching and foam modeling helped evaluate how users might interact with angle-adjustable designs.

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Prototyping & Testing</h3>
        <p class="content-text">
          We created low-fidelity cardboard mockups and later 3D-printed prototypes to test adjustability and comfort with users. Usability testing led to key design changes, such as a smoother hinge motion and simplified base shape. <br /><br />
